## Reporting a Bug

While bugs are unfortunate, they're a reality in software. We can't fix what we
don't know about, so please report liberally. If you're not sure if something is
a bug or not, feel free to file a bug anyway.

If you have the chance, before reporting a bug, please search existing issues,
as it's possible that someone else has already reported the error. This doesn't
always work, and sometimes it's hard to know what to search for, so consider
this extra credit. We won't mind if you accidentally file a duplicate report.

Opening an issue is as easy as following [this link](https://github.com/postlight/lorem-ipsum-generator-generator/issues/new)
and filling out the template.
